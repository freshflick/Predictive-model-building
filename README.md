# Predictive Analytics with Python
This is a Jupyter Notebook project that explores and builds predictive models using a real-world dataset. This project demonstrates various data science techniques such as multi-class classification, clustering, handling missing values, and model evaluation â€” all using Python.

## Purpose:
- To conduct predictive analytics on a dataset by building and evaluating machine learning models.
- The aim is to showcase key skills in data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation in a clean, reproducible Python workflow using Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) in a Jupyter-compatible environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code, or Anaconda).

3. Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.).

4. Run the notebook cell by cell to:
      -   Explore the dataset
      -   Train SVM and clustering models
      -   Evaluate performance
      -   Visualize results

Note: You may need to modify the notebook path if you're using your own dataset.

## Why I built this project?
This project was an opportunity for me to experiment with real-world datasets and apply various machine learning techniques in an exploratory, hands-on way.

It allowed me to develop my skills and interest in the following scenarios:
- Investigating multiple datasets to find one with interesting structure or challenges
- Explore different data preparation strategies, including handling missing values and outliers
- Try out various classification models, with a focus on Support Vector Machines (SVM) for multi-class problems
- Apply clustering algorithms like k-means to uncover hidden groupings in data
- Evaluate and compare models using performance metrics to understand their strengths and limitations
- Experiment with different preprocessing pipelines and see how small changes affect outcomes
